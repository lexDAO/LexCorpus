*IMPORTANT NOTE*: This is an alpha release of a potential model DAO Charter for DAOs wishing to function as unincorporated associations. 

There are a large number of assumptions embedded in this document. Among the most important is that the DAO shares/membership interests are NOT securities. This model form would not be suitable for DAOs whose tokens/membership interests are securities. 

Because there is no limited liability vehicle (such as an LLC or corporation) contemplated for the DAO in this model form, to be quasi-safely used in practice, the approach would need to be implemented with various extrinsic safeguards, such as specific public disclaimers regarding the ability of DAO Members to bind other DAO Members, and specific contracting practices when DAO Members are contracting with third parties regarding use of DAO funds, etc. It would not be appropriate for all use cases. 

Code deference exists along a spectrum, with one end being "code is law" and the other being "code is no substitute for law whatsoever." The code deference approach taken by this form may be characterized as "qualified code deference" and builds on the example set forth in the "Simple Code Deference Agreement." For more on qualified code deference & the rationale thereof, see here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzbMPLxiht4.

###  I. NATURE OF DAO CHARTER

 (a) This charter (this “***Charter***”) is the official legal charter of the DAO formed hereby. This Charter is intended to be a legal agreement & contract binding upon all DAO Members and the other DAO Participants, as they may join and exit the DAO, from time to time, and is enforceable in accordance with its terms under the laws of Wyoming. Certain capitalized terms used in this Charter are defined in Section 6. 

  (b) If you have received any DAO Membership Token or are otherwise a DAO Member, you consent to & agree to become legally bound by this Charter as both a DAO Participant and more specifically a "***DAO Member***".    
  
###  II. NAME, PURPOSES AND STRUCTURE OF THE DAO
 
 (a) The name of the DAO is as set forth in the transaction recorded on the Designated Blockchain as deployed in the formation signature under the smart contract located at the Ethereum Name Service domain, daosummoner.eth.
 
 (b) The DAO is a "decentralized autonomous organization"--i.e., an unincorporated association of individuals, entities, associations and/or other persons or groups of persons.
 
 (c) The DAO is not intended to, and shall not be deemed to, be a legal person or have a legal personality separate from the DAO Members. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the DAO is not intended to be, and shall not be deemed to be, a partnership. 
 
  (d) The DAO Members shall utilize the Designated Smart Contract (a smart contract deployed to the Designated Blockchain at the Designated Blockchain Address) as the exclusive method of holding, allocating among the DAO Members, and spending or otherwise distributing any Tokens that are DAO Property, of minting and issuing DAO Membership Tokens and holding and recording votes of the DAO Members. The DAO may also utilize the Designated Smart Contract to administer and facilitate certain other arrangements and transactions involving the DAO, the DAO Members and/or third Members.
  
 ###  III. DAO SHARES & MEMBERSHIP
 
 (a) A person shall be deemed to be a DAO Member if and only if an instance of the Membership struct has been created with respect to such person in the Designated Smart Contract. Each Membership struct shall record the public key with respect to which the DAO Member may exercise its rights as a DAO Member through the Designated Smart Contract and the number of DAO Membership Tokens issued to and held by such DAO Member, and may also record any other relevant information regarding a DAO Member, as determined by the available key: value pairings within the Membership struct of the Designated Smart Contract.   

 (b) Membership rights in the DAO shall be represented by Tokens (the "***DAO Membership Tokens***") minted and issued through the Designated Smart Contract. 

 (c) DAO Members shall have the rights, powers and privileges that are possible to be taken or exercised by DAO Members through the Designated Smart Contract as further set forth in Section 4. The rights, powers and privileges of DAO Members are referred to herein as the "***DAO Membership Rights***".

 (d) Status as a DAO Member does not (and shall not be deemed to) create, and the DAO Membership Rights do not (and shall not be deemed to) include, any authority, right or power on the part of a DAO Member to act as the agent, representative or attorney of or otherwise act on behalf of the DAO or any other DAO Member, to bind the DAO or any other DAO Member to any Contract or Liability or to Convey any DAO Property or any asset, right or property owned or held by or on behalf of the DAO or any DAO Member.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no DAO Member shall be deemed the partner of the DAO or any other DAO Member. No DAO Member shall state, purport, imply, hold out or represent to any person that such DAO Member or any other DAO Member has any such authority, right or power.  
 
 (e) To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, no DAO Member shall be (or shall be deemed to be) Liable for any Liability of the DAO or any other DAO Member. This clause "(e)" shall not (and shall not be deemed to) create or imply any obligation of the DAO or any DAO Member to indemnify or compensate any DAO Member from, or hold any DAO Member harmless against, any Liabilities incurred by such DAO Member under any applicable law, in connection with the DAO Member's participation in the DAO or otherwise.  
  
###  IV. BINDING EFFECT OF THE DESIGNATED SMART CONTRACT

(a) *General Binding Effect.*

(i) *Smart Contract Deference.* Except as set forth in Section 4(b): 

  (A) the results of operation of the Designated Smart Contract shall be determinative of the rights and obligations of, and shall be final, binding upon and non-appealable by, each of the DAO Members with respect to the DAO, the DAO Purposes, the DAO Shares, the DAO Property and the Distributed DAO Property (the "***DAO Matters***")'
  
   (B) each DAO Member has the unconditional right to take any action or exercise any right, power or privilege that is possible to be taken or exercised by a DAO Member with a DAO Membership Token or by interacting with the Designated Smart Contract, including transferring a DAO Membership Token (to the extent the Designated Smart Contract permits such transfers), calling any function of the Designated Smart Contract, Conveying any Token to the Designated Smart Contract or receiving any Token from the Designated Smart Contract; 
   
   (C) no DAO Member has any duties or responsibilities to make any particular use of the DAO Membership Token or interact with the Designated Smart Contract at all or in any particular way; *provided*, *however*, that this clause "(C)" does not and shall not be deemed to limit any other provision of this Charter, including the requirement set forth in the preceding clause "(A)" that a DAO Member shall be bound by the results of operations of the Designated Smart Contract; 

(ii) *Smart Contract Preempts Contrary Legal Contracts.* Except as set forth in Section 4(b), if in connection with any DAO Matters there is any conflict or inconsistency between: (A)(1) this Charter or (2) any other Contract between or among any DAO Members; and (B) any Contract created or implied by, or embodied in, the machine, assembly or other code, or the results of operation, of the Designated Smart Contract, then the Contract referred to in the preceding clause “(B)” shall prevail over the Contract referred to in the preceding clause “(A).” Notwithstanding the foregoing, particular DAO Members may opt out of this Section 4(a)(ii), solely as to themselves and without any adverse effect on other DAO Members, to the extent expressly provided in a written legal agreement, provided that the execution of such agreement is announced to all DAO Members and an accurate and complete copy of such agreement is made readily available to all DAO Members. 

(iii) *Prohibition of Legal Proceedings & Transfers.* No DAO Member shall, without the prior written unanimous consent of the other DAO Members, directly or indirectly take or attempt to take any of the following actions:

   (A) except as set forth in Section 4(b) or to the extent necessary to enforce the express provisions of this Charter, commence or continue any Legal Proceeding, assert any Claim or enforce any judgment or other Order, in each case, that (1) is against or involves any other DAO Member(s), (2) relates to this Charter or the matters contemplated by this Charter, the Designated Smart Contract, the DAO Property or any of the other DAO Matters, including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Legal Proceeding or Order *in rem* pertaining to the DAO Property or any Legal Proceeding or Claim challenging the enforceability of any provision of this Charter;
    
   (B) Convey any of the DAO Property other than such DAO Member's Distributed DAO Property (it being understood that for a DAO Member to “***Convey***” any of the DAO Property means for such DAO Member to, or to enter into any Contract that may obligate such DAO Member, any other DAO Member or the DAO to: (1) create, perfect or enforce any Lien on, (2) pledge, hypothecate, grant an option or derivative security, swap or other instrument with respect to or (3) convey, sell, transfer or dispose of such DAO Property or any right or interest of the DAO or any DAO Member to or in such DAO Property); or
    
   (C) cause, assist, encourage or facilitate, a Material Adverse Exception Event.

(b) *Exception Handling.* Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 4(a), if there is a Material Adverse Exception Event, then the rules and procedures set forth in this clause "(b)" shall determine the rights and obligations of the DAO Members relating to the DAO Property.

   (i) *Exception Notice.* If any DAO Member becomes aware that there is a Material Adverse Exception Event, such DAO Member (the “***Sending Member***”) shall deliver to the other DAO Members (the “***Receiving Members***”) a notice (an “***Exception Notice***”):

   (A) certifying that the Sending Member believes in good faith that there is a Material Adverse Exception Event;

   (B) describing in reasonable detail the events, facts, circumstances and reasons forming the basis of such belief;

   (C) if and only if desired, describing in reasonable detail a proposal by such DAO Member of the actions to be taken, the agreements to be entered into, and the remedies to be sought by the DAO Members in response to the Material Adverse Exception Event an “***Exception Handling Proposal***”;

   (D) including copies of any written evidence or other material written information, and summaries of any other evidence, relevant to, and material for the consideration of, the Material Adverse Exception Event and the other matters referred to in the Exception Notice; and

   (E) containing a representation by the Sending Member, made to and for the benefit of the Receiving Members with the understanding that the Receiving Members will rely thereon, that, to the Sending Member’s knowledge, the certification and statements made pursuant to the preceding clauses “(A)” and “(B)” are accurate as of the date of the Exception Notice, and, considered collectively, do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make such statements, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading.

   (ii) *Exception Standstill.* During the period starting on the date of delivery of an Exception Notice and ending with the DAO Members entering into an Exception Handling Addendum or receiving a final decision of an arbitrator in accordance with Section 4(b)(iii) (the “***Standstill Period***”), each DAO Member shall: (A) treat all of the Distributed DAO Property of such DAO Member that may have been Transferred to such DAO Member as a result of the Material Adverse Exception Event as if it were DAO Property, including by disregarding the parenthetical exceptions for Distributed DAO Property in Section 4(a)(iii); and (B) deposit and maintain such Distributed DAO Property in a segregated Account Address to be treated, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, as a custodial trust held for the benefit of the DAO Members.

   (iii) *Determination of Exception Handling.*

   (A) The term “***Exception Handling Addendum***” refers to an addendum to this Charter  setting forth the DAO Members’ agreement on the existence or non-existence of a Material Adverse Exception Event and the actions to be taken, the agreements to be entered into, and the remedies to be sought in response thereto. Each Exception Handling Addendum shall automatically and without further action of the DAO Members be deemed incorporated into and to form a part of this Charter.

   (B) During the continuous 10-day period beginning on the date of delivery of the Exception Notice (the “***Negotiation Period***”), the DAO Members shall use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate in good faith to agree upon the existence or non-existence of a Material Adverse Exception Event and, if so agreed, the actions to be taken, the agreements to be entered into and the remedies to be sought by the DAO Members in response to the Material Adverse Exception Event. If the DAO Members agree upon such matters during the Negotiation Period, the DAO Members shall promptly enter into an Exception Handling Addendum reflecting the same.

   (C) If the DAO Members fail to reach an agreement resulting in an Exception Handling Addendum during the Negotiation Period, then either DAO Member may initiate an arbitration action to resolve the issues in accordance with the procedures set forth at https://adr.org/sites/default/files/Commercial%20Rules.pdf (the “***Arbitration Procedures***”). The decision resulting from the Arbitration Procedures shall include, among any other determinations, a determination of the treatment of any Distributed DAO Property and whether to extend, modify or terminate the covenants applying to the Distributed DAO Property during the Standstill Period. The decision resulting from the Arbitration Procedures shall be non- appealable, binding and conclusive upon the DAO Members. Judgment upon such a decision may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
