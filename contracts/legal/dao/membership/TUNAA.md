# Article V - Governance Shares and Capital Shares

**Section 5.1 - Issuance and terms.** It is noted that different Designated Smart Contracts have different manners of managing governance shares (“[DAO Membership Units Ticker]”) versus contributed capital and efforts resulting in retains to [DAO Informal Name] (“Loot Shares”).  Currently, [DAO Membership Units Ticker] members have no rights of redemption of any working capital, or token assets, held within [DAO Informal Name].  In the future, to evidence capital or contributions of efforts provided by members, the [DAO Informal Name] may issue “Loot Shares”. Loot Shares may be issued only to persons eligible for and admitted to membership in [DAO Informal Name]. Loot Shares shall be considered issued upon their issue and they need not be evidenced by certificates.  Loot Shares shall be entitled to no dividend or other monetary return on contributed capital and may not be used to secure loans or other obligations of members. Loot Shares shall be subject to assessment for the reasonable capital needs of [DAO Informal Name], as determined by mutual agreement.  Loot Shares (if issued) should be considered to be similar to restricted donations and are envisioned as a manner of tracking contributions made to the nonprofit, yet are retrievable by the holder should they beleive that the [DAO Informal Name] no longer is fulfilling its purpose, the process for signalling such a redeption of Loot Shares is a "Loot Quit".  It is not anticipated that [DAO Informal Name] will ever turn a “profit” as excess capital will be paid out via charitable donations, grants, or other forms of support meant to carry out the Mission Statement.

**Section 5.2 - Redemption.** Upon request following termination of [DAO Informal Name] membership or via a future Smart Contract Mechanism to remove capital via a burn of Loot Shares, the Loot Shares shall be redeemed via a mechanism to be determined by [DAO Membership Units Ticker] members.  A “Rage Quit” is a request to burn both [DAO Membership Units Ticker] Membership token and Loot Shares. A “Loot Quit”, is simply to burn and withdraw Loot Shares as return of retreivable funds.  Loot Shares (if ever created) shall be redeemable at the approved Designated Smart Contract less a reasonable processing fee (if any). Burning Loot Shares if/when [DAO Informal Name] is near the zone of insolvency may result in personal action to reclaim capital to the insolvent organization, fraudulent conveyance recapture, etc.

**Section 6.2 - Material Adverse Exception Event.** Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 4, if there is a Material Adverse Exception Event, then the rules and procedures set forth in this clause shall determine the rights and obligations of the [DAO Membership Units Ticker] holding members relating to the [DAO Informal Name] property.
