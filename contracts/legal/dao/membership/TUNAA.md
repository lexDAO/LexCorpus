# Article V - Governance Shares and Capital Shares

**Section 5.1 - Issuance and terms.** It is noted that different Designated Smart Contracts have different manners of managing governance shares (“[DAO Membership Units Ticker]”) versus contributed capital and efforts resulting in retains to [DAO Informal Name] (“Loot Shares”).

Loot Shares shall be entitled to no dividend or other monetary return on contributed capital and may not be used to secure loans or other obligations of members.

**Section 7.5 - Net losses.** No portion of a net operating loss realized by the Cooperative shall be allocated to members.
