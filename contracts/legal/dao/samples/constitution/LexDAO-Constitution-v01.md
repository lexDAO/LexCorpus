# Constitution of LexDAO Club 

### Originally Adopted July 24, 2020


# Article I - Organization

**Section 1.1 - Status.**  LexDAO Club (referred to in this agreement as "LexDAO") is an unincorporated nonprofit association under Wyo. Stat. Title 17, Ch. 22 of the laws of the State of Wyoming.

LexDAO is not intended to be, and shall not be deemed to be, a partnership.

**Section 1.2 - Purposes.** As more fully stated in its Mission Statement (as may be updated from time to time via governance) LexDAO is organized to form a club of legal engineering professionals, united to innovate and bring the traditional legal settlement layer to code, and coded agreements to the masses. We believe that everyone deserves access to justice provided in a quick and efficient manner. If legal services were easier to use, verify, and enforce, we could live in a fairer world. Distributed ledger technology offers solutions to many problems in the legal space. Our mission is to research, develop and evangelize first-class legal methods and blockchain protocols that secure rules and promises with code rather than trust. We do this by training LexDAO certified legal engineers and building LexDAO certified blockchain applications. We strive to balance new deterministic tools with the equitable considerations of law to better serve citizens on a cooperative and nonprofit basis for the primary and mutual benefit of its members and common good.

**Section 1.3 - Not a Law Firm and Not Your Lawyer.** LexDAO is not a law firm and cannot give legal advice.  Any information or artifacts provided by LexDAO or its members does not, and is not intended to, constitute professional legal opinion; instead, all information, content, and materials are for general informational, academic commentary and educational purposes only.  

LexDAO members, or users of any LexDAO resources, should contact their attorney to obtain advice with respect to any particular legal matter. No reader, user, or browser of LexDAO website or services should act or refrain from acting on the basis of information on this site without first seeking legal advice from counsel in the relevant jurisdiction. Only your individual personal attorney can provide assurances that the information contained herein – and your interpretation of it – is applicable or appropriate to your particular situation. Use of, and access to, LexDAO, any LexDAO website or any of the links or resources contained within the site do not create an attorney-client relationship between the reader, user, or browser and website authors, contributors, contributing law firms, or committee members and their respective employers.

**Section 1.4 - Cooperative principles.** LexDAO shall be operated in the spirit of cooperative principles framed by the 1995 General Assembly of the International Co-operative Alliance, including: (i) voluntary and open membership; (ii) democratic member control through distributed ledger smart contract voting management; (iii) member economic participation; (iv) autonomy and independence of LexDAO; (v) providing education, training and information; (vi) cooperation with other DAO cooperatives; and (vii) concern for community.

**Section 1.5 - Nondiscrimination.** LexDAO shall not arbitrarily discriminate on the basis of race, nationality, religion, age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, political affiliation, or otherwise.  

**Section 1.6 - Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).** LexDAO is a DAO, an unincorporated association of individuals, entities, associations and/or other persons or groups of persons who all agree to join together in a common purpose. For LexDAO that purpose is encapsulated in our Mission Statement.

# Article II - Membership

**Section 2.1 - Eligibility** Membership as defined in Wyo. Stat. Title 17, Ch. 22 shall be voluntary and application open to any individual of at least 18 years of age whose purpose or presumed intent is to contribute, to build, and to use the services of LexDAO and is willing to accept the responsibilities and terms of membership. 

**Section 2.2 - Admission.** The membership of LexDAO applicants will be granted or denied by vote upon the submission of required information on a prescribed application form, paying any required application fee, and contributing to LexDAO., if any, all as determined by the membership. The contribution requirement may be waived in whole or in part for persons of low income.  LexDAO is a decentralized network of members and may admit or deny for any arbitrary purpose or lack of purpose.

All LexDAO governing members will receive one LexDAO Member Token (each a “LDM”). LDM is a membership and voting token for participating in and improving the governance of LexDAO via the Designated Smart Contract. Once the admission requirements are met the prospective member may be put up to a vote of the full LDM membership. LexDAO will consistently review, and if necessary LDM members can make adjustments to the admission requirements based on its evolving needs.  Current path to initiate a proposal to join membership and  to signal members for a vote can be found in the LexDAO Handbook, and may be updated from time to time.

**Section 2.3 - Rights.** LexDAO Members shall utilize the “Designated Smart Contract” (a smart contract deployed to the Designated Blockchain at the Designated Blockchain Address (currently an Aragon application) as the exclusive method of holding, allocating among the LDM Members, and spending, or otherwise distributing any Tokens that are LexDAO property, of minting and issuing LDM Membership Tokens and holding and recording votes of the LDM Members. LexDAO may also utilize the Designated Smart Contract to administer and facilitate certain other arrangements and transactions involving LexDAO, the LDM Members and/or third parties.

LexDAO Members’ rights and responsibilities are controlled by the use of the Designated Smart Contact used to conduct its governance and LexDAO activities. LexDAO's Aragon Agent is located at LexDAO’s designated Ethereum Web3 address **(0x97103fda00a2b47EaC669568063C00e65866a633)** through LexDAO governance to act on behalf of LexDAO, to contract on behalf of the DAO through a LDM membership vote.  LDM members will cast votes and carry out the decisions made on the Designated Smart Contract.  LDM tokens are held in Account Addresses, key paired wallets controlled by LDM Members in a designated hexadecimal address (“Member Web3 Account”). The registry of Member Web3 Account addresses holding LDM governance tokens of LexDAO can be found here: https://nightly.aragon.org/#/lexdao/0xc191dc522672e10441bb9ee7c58946e9a8ebe4c0/.

**Section 2.4 - Responsibilities.** By accepting and retaining membership each applicant shall agree to use the services of LexDAO on at least an occasional basis. Each member shall keep reasonably current in payment of any dues or membership fees and other financial obligations of membership. Each member shall notify LexDAO of an e-mail address or other acceptable communication channel by which the member may receive written or electronic materials required or permitted by this document or shall notify LexDAO that the member has no e-mail address and designate the mutually acceptable form of communication.

If you have received any LDM or are otherwise a DAO Member, you consent to contact and agree to become legally bound by this Agreement as both a LexDAO participant and more specifically a "LexDAO Member".

**Section 2.5 - Limitations.**  Status as a LexDAO Member does not (and shall not be deemed to) create, and the LexDAO Membership Rights do not (and shall not be deemed to) include, any authority, right or power on the part of a LexDAO Member to act as the agent, representative or attorney of or otherwise act on behalf of LexDAO or any other LDM Member, to bind LexDAO or any other LDM Member to any Contract or Liability or to convey any LexDAO property or any asset, right or property owned or held by or on behalf of LexDAO or any LDM Member. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no LDM Member shall be deemed the partner of LexDAO or any other LDM Member. No LDM Member shall state, purport, imply, hold out or represent to any person that such LDM Member or any other LDM Member has any such authority, right or power.

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, no LDM Member shall be (or shall be deemed to be) liable for any liability of the LexDAO or any other LDM Member. This shall not (and shall not be deemed to) create or imply any obligation of LexDAO or any LDM Member to indemnify or compensate any LDM Member from, or hold any LDM Member harmless against, any Liabilities incurred by such DAO Member under any applicable law, in connection with the LDM Member's participation in LexDAO or otherwise.

**Section 2.6 - Inactive status.** A member who falls from good standing may have their membership revoked or suspended through the vote of LDM Membership (each said action, a “Guild Kick/Member Removal”).

Neither party with a grievance against the other shall have recourse to litigation until the matter is submitted to mediation and attempted to be resolved in good faith.  All LDM Membership agree that there is a preference to settle disputes amongst members or between members and LexDAO via decentralized dispute mechanisms via smart contract protocols. 

**Section  2.9 - Transferability of Membership.** Membership rights and interests may not be transferred except by vote of LexDAO membership.  Any attempted transfer contrary to this section shall be wholly void and shall confer no rights on the intended transferee and shall be cause (though none is needed) to burn the LDM token through a Guild Kick member removal procedure.

**Section 2.10 - Withdrawal and Expulsion.** A member may withdraw at any time upon notice to LexDAO through a vote to burn their LDM token.  Said request will not be unreasonably denied and shall be deemed conclusively as the LDM Members intent to withdraw from LexDAO.

 # Article IV - Decentralized Governance

**Section 4.1 - Powers and duties.** Except as to matters reserved to members by law or by this constitution, all LexDAO powers shall be exercised by or under the authority of LDM members or such agents or designees approved by LDM Members through Designated Smart Contract voting.

**Section 4.2 – Emergency Powers.** At the inception of the DAO, or within 72 hours of the adoption of Sections 4.2-4.8, the members of the DAO shall vote to appoint an initial emergency member set of [X] members, the Emergency Board, as well as a Subsequent Emergency Board, which shall serve following the term of the Emergency Board. The Emergency Board shall be appointed by a simple majority vote at which a quorum is present. The initial state of the Emergency Board shall be set to “inactive”. When the Emergency Board state is set to “active”, the Board shall have the power to pause any or all pending proposals, rewards programs, and treasury transactions pending a review of the DAO’s protocols, member participation, and any governance malfeasance.

**Section 4.3 - Emergency Board Activation.** The Emergency Board can be activated by one of two means: (1) a simple majority vote of a quorum may activate the Emergency Board or (2) the Emergency Board may activate itself by a supermajority vote of the members of the Emergency Board.  When activated, the DAO shall be considered in an emergency state.

**Section 4.4 - Self Activation.** If the Emergency Board is activated by a supermajority vote of the members of the Emergency Board and makes a decision to suspend any activity, the members shall first stake their token holdings. The Emergency Board members shall not be able to unstake their tokens for a period of 36 hours after a suspended activity is resumed.

**Section 4.5 - Emergency Board Recommendation.** Upon becoming Active, the Emergency Board shall conduct a review of the factors giving rise to the emergency state. Within 36 hours, or, upon giving a detailed update for the need for an extension, within 72 hours, the Emergency Board shall submit its findings regarding the emergency state and recommendations for remedial actions to the DAO. The Board shall designate for each proposal whether adoption is “critical” or “important”. A proposal is critical if, but for its adoption, the DAO would be unable to function in a manner consistent with the DAO’s mission and Charter. A proposal shall be important if it is helpful to stabilize the DAO’s function in light of the declared emergency, but not critical.

**Section 4.6 - Emergency Board Proposal Vote.** Within 36 hours of receiving the Emergency Board’s proposals and recommendations, the DAO shall vote on whether to adopt the Board’s proposed actions. A quorum for an Emergency Board Proposal Vote shall require [Y% of voting share]. In order to adopt a proposal, [supermajority] of the quorum must vote in favor.

**Section 4.7 - Procedure Following Vote.** If any critical vote fails, the sitting Emergency Board shall automatically be replaced by the subsequent Emergency Board, in accordance with 4.8 below. If all critical votes succeed, the Emergency Board shall oversee the implementation of the remedial actions and manage communications on behalf of the DAO for 48 hours after the vote, after which time, the Emergency Board’s term shall end. 

**Section 4.8 - Term, Subsequent Emergency Board, and Election.** In the absence of a declared emergency, an Emergency Board shall have a term of two years. Elections for a replacement Subsequent Emergency Board shall occur 18 months after the start of any Emergency Board term.

# Article V - Governance Shares and Capital Shares

**Section 5.1 - Issuance and terms.** It is noted that different Designated Smart Contracts have different manners of managing governance shares (“LDM”) versus contributed capital and efforts resulting in retains to LexDAO (“Loot Shares”).  Currently, LDM members have no rights of redemption of any working capital, or token assets, held within LexDAO.  In the future, to evidence capital or contributions of efforts provided by members, the Co-op may issue “Loot Shares”. Loot Shares may be issued only to persons eligible for and admitted to membership in LexDAO. Loot Shares shall be considered issued upon their issue and they need not be evidenced by certificates.  Loot Shares shall be entitled to no dividend or other monetary return on contributed capital and may not be used to secure loans or other obligations of members. Loot Shares shall be subject to assessment for the reasonable capital needs of LexDAO, as determined by mutual agreement.  Loot Shares (if issued) should be considered to be similar to “retains” and are envisioned as a manner of tracking contributions made to the nonprofit.  It is not anticipated that LexDAO will ever turn a “profit” as excess capital will be paid out via charitable donations, grants, or other forms of support meant to carry out the Mission Statement.

**Section 5.2 - Redemption.** Upon request following termination of LexDAO membership or via a future Smart Contract Mechanism to remove capital via a burn of Loot Shares, the Loot Shares shall be redeemed via a mechanism to be determined by LDM members.  A “Rage Quit” is a request to burn both LDM Membership token and Loot Shares. A “Loot Quit”, is simply to burn and withdraw Loot Shares as return of retains.  Loot Shares (if ever created) shall be redeemable at the approved Designated Smart Contract less a reasonable processing fee (if any).

# Article VI - Guild Kick/Member Removal and Exit

**Section 6.1 - Guild Kick/Member Removal Procedures.**  Shall be governed by the Handbook.

**Section 6.2 - Material Adverse Exception Event.** Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 4, if there is a Material Adverse Exception Event, then the rules and procedures set forth in this clause shall determine the rights and obligations of the LDM holding members relating to the LexDAO property.

# Article VII - Patronage Dividends

**Section 7.1 - Distribution obligation.** The realized net earnings of LexDAO attributable to the patronage of members through contributions and voting shall be allocated and distributed among members in proportion to their patronage and in such a manner and at such a time as to constitute patronage dividends within the meaning of federal income tax law. Unless otherwise required under federal tax law all of the operations of the LexDAO shall be netted into a single allocation unit.

**Section 7.2 - Reductions.** Any distributable net earnings of such a nominal amount as not to justify the expenses of distribution may, as determined by the LexDAO Advisory Group pr LDM Members, be excluded from distribution. Net earnings may be reduced by such reasonable reserves for necessary business purposes as is determined by the LexDAO Advisory Group or LDM Members. A patronage dividend to which members are entitled may be waived in whole or in part by vote of members.

**Section 7.3 - Consent of members.** By obtaining or retaining membership in LexDAO, each member shall there by consent to take into account, in the manner and to the extent required by Section 1385 of the Internal Revenue Code, the stated dollar amount of any qualified written notice of allocation in the taxable year in which such notice is received.

**Section 7.4 - Deferred amounts.** Payment of patronage dividends may be deferred for the reasonable capital needs of LexDAO, as determined by LDM Members. Such amounts shall accrue no dividend or other monetary return on capital. Deferred patronage dividends may be redeemed when determined by LDM Members to be no longer needed for capital purposes. 

**Section 7.5 - Net losses.** No portion of a net operating loss realized by the Cooperative shall be allocated to members. The patronage portion of such losses shall be carried forward to offset patronage-sourced income of subsequent years. The non patronage portion of such losses shall be carried back and forward to offset non patronage-sourced income of prior and subsequent years as required or permitted under federal income tax law. As a nonprofit unincorporated association, it is not anticipated there will be tax returns or profits.

**Section 7.6 - Failure to Claim or Redeem.** The patronage dividend distributed to any member, by any means, including as cash, as a voucher, or by digital asset may be used for the purchase of LexDAO items and services, or donated to LexDAO. The portion of a patronage dividend distributed to any member that is not claimed, used, redeemed or donated within 90 days of issuance date, or by the next June 30th from issuance date, whichever is later, shall potentially revert to LexDAO as a donation without further notice to the member. Such portions of patronage dividends that are donated or that revert to LexDAO as provided in this subsection shall be distributed and allocated to a tax-exempt charity or grant as the LDM Members may determine.

Indemnification payments shall be made on a priority basis but only in such increments and at such times as will not jeopardize the ability of LexDAO to pay its other obligations as they become due.

**Section 8.3 - Communication by electronic means.** Unless otherwise required by law or by agreement, any notice, vote, consent, petition, or other oral or written communication required or permitted can be delivered by electronic means, provided that, in the case where such communication expressly or impliedly requires the signature of the person submitting the communication, means are in place to reasonably assure the authenticity of the signature.


# Article IX - Interpretation and Amendment of Constitution

**Section 9.3 - Amendment.** This Constitution may be amended by presenting the redlined version of the amendments at a meeting of members, and adopted by a vote or merge request as prescribed in the Handbook. As a form of soft consensus, any LDM Member may timely protest a merge request made to the Constitution that has not been adopted as an approved version by LDM Members via the Designated Smart Contract.
