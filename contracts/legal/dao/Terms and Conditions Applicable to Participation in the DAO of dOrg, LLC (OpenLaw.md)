\centered **Terms and Conditions Applicable to Participation in the DAO of dOrg, LLC**

The following Terms and Conditions (the “*Conditions*”) are a legally binding contract between [[Participant]] (“*you*”), the participant in the decentralized autonomous organization protocol known as [[dOrg]] (the “*DAO*”), made available by [[dOrg]], LLC, a Vermont blockchain-based limited liability company (the “*Company*” or “*we*” or “*us*”) available here. Together, you and we are collectively known as the “*Parties*” or, individually, as a “*Party*”.

In order to participate in the DAO, you must agree to read, accept, adhere to, and be bound by all of the provisions contained in these Conditions. If you do not accept the Conditions in their entirety, you are not permitted to use the DAO. By participating in the DAO, you represent that you have read the Conditions and agree to adhere to and be bound by all of the Conditions in their entirety.

The Company may amend these Conditions at any time with five (5) days’ written notice to you, which notice may be given electronically, including in or through the DAO. Your continued participation in the DAO after the effective date of a revised version of the Conditions constitutes your acceptance of its terms. 

Participation in of the DAO does not constitute, require, or automatically grant membership in the Company. Membership rights are granted and governed according to the provisions of the **Company’s Operating Agreement**.

^ **Section 1. Authority to Contract; Eligibility to Use the DAO.** By accessing, using, submitting a profile to, posting or responding to a request for work with a proposed “*Project Specification Sheet*” (as defined in the “*Contractor Term Sheet*”), or otherwise engaging with the DAO, you affirm that you are at least eighteen (18) years of age. You also represent, acknowledge, and agree that (i) you are interacting with the DAO on your own behalf; (ii) that you have the legal capacity and the right to enter into a binding agreement; and (iii) that your interaction with the DAO and your agreement to these Conditions does not violate any law or government rule applicable to you.

^ **Section 2. Types of Services and Related Rights.** The Company runs the DAO(??). Individuals, organizations, corporate entities, or other participants, both Members and NonMembers of the Company (the “*Participants*”) may be permitted to use and access the DAO. One of the uses to which the Company puts the DAO is soliciting proposals from Participants for the performance of technical services (the “*Services*”), both for third parties and for the Company itself, including for development or enhancement of the DAO itself. For all such Services, regardless of whether they are performed for third parties or for the Company and/or the DAO, the Company and the relevant Participant will agree on the scope of the work, the deliverables, and the rate and terms of payment through a Project Specification Sheet approved by the Members through a vote conducted via the DAO, as supplemented by the Contractor Term Sheet applicable to all Services contracted by the DAO. The third party may also submit a project using other documentation, provided that the acceptance of such submissions shall be entirely at the discretion of [[dOrg]], which must approve its use via the DAO process, and of the eventual Participant who will perform the Project. If approved and accepted by them, such documentation will be deemed to be the Term Sheet. In the case of a conflict between such other documentation acting as the Term Sheet, and the provisions of the Terms and Conditions for submission of projects, the provisions of the Terms and Conditions will prevail unless such conflict is expressly identified as such and is expressly approved via the DAO process and by the Participant.

^ **Section 3. Payment.** No payment of any kind is due under the Conditions or as a matter of the parties’ relationship. Any payment or right to the same will be determined by the parties on a per-project basis in each Work Order. The form of payment for Services will be agreed upon by the parties in the Work Order, but all payments are expected to be made in digital currencies or tokens, including, but not limited to, Ethereum. Any payment due to a Participant for work performed for a third party through the DAO is contingent upon the Company first receiving the third party’s payment for the work. The Company will issue and store invoices and receipts in and through the DAO.

^ **Section 4. Term.** These Terms and Conditions will continue to apply to the Parties hereto unless and until terminated by any Party, through notice to the other Party.

The Company expressly disclaims any and all liability for any access problems or limitations, bugs, errors, viruses, damaging or malicious software; data charges associated with use of the DAO; and results obtained from use of the DAO.

Any termination, suspension, or denial of rights and access may be with or without notice to you, and will not produce or give rise to any liability from
the Company to you.
