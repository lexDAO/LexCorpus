[PUBLIC KEY ADDRESS[ES]] ([collectively,] the “Delegated Address[es]”), 

[The Delegated Address has/Each of the Delegated Addresses have] staked a certain amount of [DAO GOV TOKENS] tokens in the governance contract for [DAO] and I intend to participate in the governance of [DAO], whether by proposing, voting, abstaining, or engaging in related discourse or otherwise, in accordance with its applicable parameters and guidelines. I understand that other externally owned accounts and addresses may delegate their voting power to [the Delegated Address[es]/me] from time to time and intend that this disclosure will generally govern my actions as a delegate.

[I/the Delegators] have instituted policies and procedures with respect to delegations in the interest of transparency, which may be subject to update from time to time and are available here [LINK] || Though [I/the Delegator(s)] do not have a formal policy, in participating in the governance of [DAO], I intend to act on the following principles:

- I will seek to remain informed about governance proposals and vote on matters from time to time using my independent judgment unless otherwise disclosed;

- I will act in good faith and use reasonable care in participating in governance, including in making proposals and in voting;

- I will endeavor to provide transparent, good faith, and honest information as to my motivations and reasoning in carrying out my role as a delegate, or when soliciting the delegation of voting power [or votes];

- I am not a party to any voting bloc, trust, or other group and will not engage in vote-buying, vote-selling, bribery, manipulation, or other undisclosed vote solicitation or coordination; and

- [To the extent I am aware of a material non-public conflict of interest that exists for a Delegator with respect to a proposal, I will refrain from voting in my capacity as a delegate for such Delegator with respect to such proposal]

**Conflict Disclosure**

I currently have [economic interests in][contractual obligations with][other relationships with] [EMPLOYER/CONTRACTOR/ASSOCIATION/AFFILIATED ENTITY], and may engage in the [OTHER DAO(S) OR PROJECT(S)] community(ies) from time to time. I may have direct or indirect economic interests in the various projects, entities, networks, and protocols related to the foregoing, and I also use and hold various other cryptocurrencies, tokens, stablecoins and other digital assets from time to time, including but not limited to [____________]. 

Except as disclosed herein, in participating in the governance of [DAO], I am not acting on behalf of [EMPLOYER/CONTRACTOR/AFFILIATED ENTITY, nor][on behalf of any client, nor] any voting power delegator, whether or not such delegation was solicited. If my views expressed in governance contexts are interpreted or used in a manner that leads to some injury or detriment, there will be no legal recourse against me as a vote delegate or otherwise, nor will there be any coverage or indemnity from any applicable insurance or similar mechanism.
