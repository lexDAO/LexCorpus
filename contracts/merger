III. Background
A. [[Target]] is a protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain. Any user can supply and borrow any asset by making their own [[Interest_Rate_Protocol_Name]] pool or by participating in an existing [[Interest_Rate_Protocol_Name]] pool. [[Target]] also offers a product called [NAME], which provides easy to access opportunities to deploy capital and earn interest.
a. [[Gov_Token_2]] is the governance token of [[Target]]. All protocol changes, improvements, and decisions are managed through an on-chain voting mechanism via [GOVERNANCE CONTRACT NAME].

B. [[Acquirer]] is a decentralized, scalable, and DeFi-native stablecoin protocol that is governed by [[AcquirerDAO]]. The stablecoin, [[Stablecoin]], is pegged to $1 target market price and is backed by Protocol Controlled Value (PCV). PCV consists of decentralized assets and is deployed to provide liquidity and earn yield.
a. [[Gov_Token_1]] is the governance token of [[AcquirerDAO]]. All protocol changes, improvements, and decisions are managed through an on-chain voting mechanism via [GOVERNANCE CONTRACT NAME].

IV. Rationale
“[[Target]] and [[Acquirer]]’s strengths play perfectly together, with many synergies coming from an [[Gov_Token_2]]/[[Gov_Token_1]] merge. The main bottlenecks to [[Interest_Rate_Protocol_Name]]’s growth are [DESCRIBE PROBLEM]. The [[Acquirer]] DAO can easily [DESCRIBE SOLUTION].

Tighter integration between the protocols would enable fundamentally new types of DeFi services. On [[Target]], the [DESCRIBE] problem is a major bottleneck, and the [[Acquirer]] DAO can help scale this through [DESCRIBE SOLUTIONS AND BENEFITS].

A united front between [[Target]] and [[Acquirer]] will enhance this relationship. For any token, [[Interest_Rate_Protocol_Name]] becomes the easiest and most frictionless way to scale out utility, and [[Stablecoin]] becomes the most liquid pair.
Our communities and teams together already have a synergistic relationship. The [[Acquirer]] DAO is actively developing cutting edge [[Interest_Rate_Protocol_Name]] infrastructure:
[DESCRIBE ACQUIRER DAO INFRASTRUCTURE]

A merge cements a long term relationship and unity of fortune that can’t be achieved by a token swap. It sets up a broader vision to be the focal point of DeFi innovation for the foreseeable future.” - [SPEAKER NAME] of [[Acquirer]]

“[[Target]] and [[Acquirer]] are two of the most powerful primitives with the potential to change the world in their own right, but they are stronger together. We’ve already gotten a hint of how powerful this collaboration can be:
[DESCRIBE BENEFITS OF MERGER]

These achievements are just a taste of what [[Target]] and [[Acquirer]] can accomplish together. I believe that we should double down on this collaborative effort for the benefit of both DAOs, communities, and the DeFi ecosystem as a whole.

I propose we bring [[Gov_Token_2]] into the [[AcquirerDAO]] family and unify our efforts in creating the future of decentralized finance. Together, we will create a DeFi capable of immense TVL scaling and truly revolutionizing the way we (DeFi users today and tomorrow) interact with money and finance.
I propose:
1. $1:$1 conversion of [[Gov_Token_2]] to [[Gov_Token_1]], created from both the existing treasury and newly minted [[Gov_Token_1]]
2. [[Acquirer]] creating proper contributor incentives as a mechanism to scale [[Interest_Rate_Protocol_Name]] / yield aggregator
3. Keep independent communities ([[Acquirer]], [[Target]]) building together under a shared [[AcquirerDAO]] family

(you can view [ACQUIRER SPEAKER NAME]’s proposal with the details of each of the mechanics here: [[Acquirer]] Letter to [[Target]] [REFERENCE NUMBER])

There are a number of protocol-specific collaborations that will be possible with the passing of this proposal. By combining the yield aggregator, [[Interest_Rate_Protocol_Name]] and [[Acquirer]] can quickly accelerate [[Stablecoin]]’s usage as a dominant stablecoin across various chains and layers. Additionally, we can work together on numerous joint products: various DAO treasury projects, automated liquidity products for new pools and even an innovative oracle model to guarantee liquidity for TWAPs. This will have no direct impact for the users of today. For the users of tomorrow, it should result in better products, better experiences and a wider set of possibilities. As a user of [[Target]], I am excited for what this means.

A treasury diversification into each other’s assets is something that we have seen before, but historically doesn’t actually provide much substance in aligning incentives because of the sheer scale of DeFi projects. By going all in with each other, we are absolutely aligned with each other’s products, communities and spirits. We are in it for the long haul, together.

By working together with the [[Acquirer]] community, becoming part of the [[AcquirerDAO]] family together, we instantly start to build our empire. Together, we are stronger than ever before. We will be ready to scale and conquer. I am excited about the potential of the [[Target]] community joining the [[AcquirerDAO]] family and I am stoked for what we will be able to do together.” - [TARGET SPEAKER NAME]

V. Voting Schedule
Parties shall agree to the following voting schedule.
A. [[AcquirerDAO]] will initiate the first proposal. Note that (a) - (f) will only execute after [[Target]] governance sets the pendingAdmin:
a. Calls method `party1Accept` on [[AcquirerDAO]]Ragequit.
b. Calls method `party1Accept` on [[Exchanger_Object_Name]].
c. Sets the [[AcquirerDAO]]Ragequit as a minter.
d. Sends [[Gov_Token_1]] to the [[Exchanger_Object_Name]].
e. Sends [[Gov_Token_1]] to [[Matchmaker]].
f. Accepts adminship of the [[Gov_Token_2]]Timelock.
B. [[Target]] governance will initiate the second proposal:
a. Transfers ownership of the Timelock to [[AcquirerDAO]].
b. Calls method `party0Accept` on [[AcquirerDAO]]Ragequit.
c. Calls method `party0Accept` on [[Exchanger_Object_Name]].
d. Transfer ownership of [[Address_1]] to [[AcquirerDAO]] Timelock.
e. Transfer ownership of [[Address_2]] to [[AcquirerDAO]] Timelock.
f. Transfer ownership of [[Address_3]] to [[AcquirerDAO]] Timelock.
g. Transfer ownership of [[Address_4]] to [[AcquirerDAO]] Timelock.
h. Transfer ownership of [[Address_5]] to [[AcquirerDAO]] Timelock.
i. Transfer ownership of [[Address_6]] to [[AcquirerDAO]] Timelock.
j. Transfer ownership of [[Address_7]] to [[AcquirerDAO]] Timelock.

VI. Distribution of [[Gov_Token_1]] to [[Gov_Token_2]] holders
[[Exchanger_Object_Name]] will facilitate the exchange of [[Gov_Token_2]] for [[Gov_Token_1]] at the Exchange Rate. [[Gov_Token_2]] may be exchanged indefinitely. [[AcquirerDAO]] governance may set an expiration date for the exchange to cease, but only at a minimum of [NUMBER] blocks, or approximately [TIME PERIOD], after the exchange starts.

VII. Governance Transition
A. [[Target]] relies on the [[Target]] governance token ([[Gov_Token_2]]), their [GOVERNANCE CONTRACT NAME] contract, team multisig ([ADDRESS]), and other contracts to function. The transfer of [[Target]]’s admin to [[AcquirerDAO]] will occur over two governance proposals. [[Target]] governance will set a pending admin, and [[AcquirerDAO]] governance will accept the admin role.
B. The [[Target]] Developer Multisig will transfer administrative rights of multisig-owned contracts noted in the Appendix to a joint multisig. See Appendix for more details regarding [[Target]] contracts and the controlling address or contract for each contract.

VIII. Ragequit
A. [[AcquirerDAO]] will permission the “[[AcquirerDAO]] Ragequit contract” as a [[Stablecoin]] minter to enable [[Stablecoin]] payouts for [[Gov_Token_1]] holders.
B. Anyone who held [[Gov_Token_1]] at the Snapshot Block will be able to exchange their [[Gov_Token_1]] for [[Stablecoin]] through the [[AcquirerDAO]] Ragequit contract, up to the amount of [[Gov_Token_1]] they held at the Snapshot Block.
C. Intrinsic Value (IV) is defined as Protocol Equity (PCV - User Circulating [[Stablecoin]]) divided by the Pre-merger [[Gov_Token_1]] Circulating Supply. The Protocol Equity number is taken from [[Stablecoin]]’s Collaterization Oracle and updated on each ragequit such that Protocol Equity can only be lowered.
D. When a [[Gov_Token_1]] holder exchanges [[Gov_Token_1]] through the [[AcquirerDAO]] Ragequit contract, the amount of [[Stablecoin]] that they receive equals the amount of [[Gov_Token_1]] sold multiplied by Intrinsic Value at the block in which the exchange takes place.
E. [[Gov_Token_1]] exchanged through the [[AcquirerDAO]] Ragequit contract will be sent to the [[AcquirerDAO]] Treasury.
F. The [[AcquirerDAO]] Ragequit contract will end after [NUMBER] blocks, or approximately [NUMBER] calendar days from the first block at which party0Accept and party1Accept are both true.

IX. Costs of Implementation
[[AcquirerDAO]] and [[Target]] will each, respectively, be solely responsible for any costs associated with due diligence, administration, deployment costs, gas fees, or any other costs unless explicitly described in this proposal.

X. [[Matchmaker]] Payment
This document describes the details of a historic DAO-to-DAO merger and is expected to set an industry precedent. [[Matchmaker]] has taken the lead in providing services related to the research, organization, development, and engineering of this merger. As compensation for these valuable services, and to foster a long term relationship between [[AcquirerDAO]] and [[Matchmaker]], [[AcquirerDAO]] will transfer [NUMBER] [[Gov_Token_1]] to an Ethereum address chosen by [[Matchmaker]].

XI. Treasury Assets and Future Assets
[[AcquirerDAO]] will assume control of all current [[Target]] treasury positions. Any future airdrops, or events that are similar to an airdrop, to [[Target]] will be controlled by [[AcquirerDAO]].

XII. Prohibitions
A. Neither [[AcquirerDAO]] nor [[Target]] will engage in any extraordinary actions after each party accepts the terms and before the merger has completed. Prohibited activities are:
1. The creation of new [[Gov_Token_2]] tokens outside of a pre-determined schedule and declared as an appendix to this proposal.
2. The creation of new [[Gov_Token_1]] tokens outside of a pre-determined schedule and declared as an appendix to this proposal.
3. The deployment of new smart contracts outside of those described and declared as an appendix to this proposal.
4. The alteration of ownership, administrative access, or other functional control over any part of [[AcquirerDAO]] governance except as described and declared as an appendix to this proposal.
5. The alteration of ownership, administrative access, or other functional control over any part of [[Target]] protocol except as described and declared as an appendix to this proposal.
6. The creation of new [[Stablecoin]] tokens outside of routine business activities or related to the execution of this agreement.
7. The receipt or provision of any incentive, financial or otherwise, for the purposes of altering voting behavior, except as outlined within this proposal or pre-determined and declared as an appendix to this proposal.
8. The manipulation of [[Stablecoin]], [[Gov_Token_1]], or [[Gov_Token_2]] prices outside of routine business activities.
B. Should [[AcquirerDAO]] or [[Target]] engage in any of the activities described in Section XII.A, then the proposed governance merge shall be considered indefinitely postponed until a new proposal has been approved by both [[AcquirerDAO]] and [[Target]].

XIII. Financial or Technical Statements
By accepting the [[AcquirerDAO]]Ragequit & [[Exchanger_Object_Name] on-chain, both [[Target]] and [[AcquirerDAO]] represent that, to the best of their knowledge, any financial or technical statements, representations, documentation, or information are correct and that all reasonable, good-faith efforts have been made to ensure their accuracy. Any financial or technical statements, representations, documentation, or information officially disclosed by either [[Target]] or [[AcquirerDAO]] are declared as an appendix to this proposal.

Executive Summary
● Each [[Gov_Token_2]] can be exchanged for [NUMBER] [[Gov_Token_1]].
● The [[Gov_Token_1]] circulating supply prior to the merger is [NUMBER].
● [[Gov_Token_1]] holders will have the opportunity to ragequit. Each [[Gov_Token_1]] will be exchanged for approximately [NUMBER] [[Stablecoin]].
○ This amount is equal to (Protocol Equity / Circulating [[Gov_Token_1]]) at the time of ragequit, and changes dynamically based on Protocol Equity.
○ All [[Stablecoin]] issued to ragequitters will be minted by [[Acquirer]].
○ All [[Gov_Token_1]] received from ragequitters will be sent to the [[AcquirerDAO]] Treasury.
○ The ragequit option will be available for [NUMBER] calendar days after the merger proposals pass.
● [[AcquirerDAO]] will cover any outstanding [[Target]] debts.

Dilution Table

<!-- insert table here -->  

The exchange of [[Gov_Token_2]] for [[Gov_Token_1]] dilutes both [[Gov_Token_1]] and [[Gov_Token_2]] holders. For example, assuming all [[Gov_Token_2]] is exchanged for [[Gov_Token_1]], if a [[Gov_Token_1]] holder who owns 10% of [[AcquirerDAO]] pre-merger holds on to all of their [[Gov_Token_1]], their ownership percentage of [[AcquirerDAO]] is reduced to [NUMBER]% as a result of the exchange. If a [[Gov_Token_2]] holder who owns 10% of [[Target]] pre-merger exchanges all of their [[Gov_Token_2]] to [[Gov_Token_1]], their ownership percentage of [[AcquirerDAO]] becomes [NUMBER]%.

On the other hand, a ragequit increases the ownership of remaining [[Gov_Token_1]] holders. For example, suppose 25% of [[Gov_Token_1]] holders ragequit after the merger. Then the ownership percentage of the [[Gov_Token_1]] holder in the above example would increase from [NUMBER]% to [NUMBER]%, and the ownership percentage of the [[Gov_Token_2]] holder in the above example would increase from [NUMBER]% to [NUMBER]%, assuming neither holder participates in the ragequit.
