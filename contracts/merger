III. Background
A. Rari Capital is a protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain. Any user can supply and borrow any asset by making their own Fuse pool or by participating in an existing Fuse pool. Rari Capital also offers a product called Vaults, which provides easy to access opportunities to deploy capital and earn interest.
a. RGT is the governance token of Rari Capital. All protocol changes, improvements, and decisions are managed through an on-chain voting mechanism via Governor Bravo.

B. Fei Protocol is a decentralized, scalable, and DeFi-native stablecoin protocol that is governed by Tribe. The stablecoin, FEI, is pegged to $1 target market price and is backed by Protocol Controlled Value (PCV). PCV consists of decentralized assets and is deployed to provide liquidity and earn yield.
a. TRIBE is the governance token of Tribe. All protocol changes, improvements, and decisions are managed through an on-chain voting mechanism via Governor OZ.

IV. Rationale
“Rari and Fei’s strengths play perfectly together, with many synergies coming from an RGT/TRIBE merge. The main bottlenecks to Fuse’s growth are bootstrapping pools with initial liquidity, and ensuring manipulation resistant oracles for long-tail assets. The Fei DAO can easily provide this initial FEI liquidity to solve the chicken-and-egg problem, and has already done so in 15 Fuse pools, including 8 of the top 10.

Tighter integration between the protocols would enable fundamentally new types of DeFi services. On Rari, the oracle problem is a major bottleneck, and the Fei DAO can help scale this through Liquidity as a Service with Ondo. By quickly and cheaply spinning up deep liquidity on Uni v3 or Balancer v2, protocols can get a manipulation resistant full-range embedded TWAP oracle to power the Fuse market. Combined with a FEI liquidity deposit, users can go end-to-end on any trade they would like to achieve in the market with existing FEI liquidity. As more pairs begin to form against FEI, the network effects grow for Fuse and FEI to list more assets and more pools with more utility for each.

A united front between Rari and Fei will enhance this relationship. For any token, Fuse becomes the easiest and most frictionless way to scale out utility, and FEI becomes the most liquid pair.
Our communities and teams together already have a synergistic relationship. The Fei DAO is actively developing cutting edge Fuse infrastructure:
● First DAO owned pool
● First incentivized pool (with dynamic incentive controls through TRIBE rewards contract)
● Generalized Plugins including LUSD Stability Pool
● Oracles through LaaS + Balancer

A merge cements a long term relationship and unity of fortune that can’t be achieved by a token swap. It sets up a broader vision to be the focal point of DeFi innovation for the foreseeable future.” - Joey Santoro of Fei

“Rari and Fei are two of the most powerful primitives with the potential to change the world in their own right, but they are stronger together. We’ve already gotten a hint of how powerful this collaboration can be:
● Fei was the first DAO to spin up a Fuse pool and deposit directly from a DAO
● Fei is directly providing liquidity into a wide spectrum of Fuse pools (10+)
● Fei has assisted in writing one of the first Fuse plugins to level up the capital
efficiency of the Liquity/LUSD fuse pool
● Fuse pools hold a large percentage of TRIBE supply
● Fei / Tribe being the first assets inside of Fuse to receive liquidity mining rewards
● Fuse has enabled Fei to directly bootstrap usage of their stablecoin in a way that Aave / Compound never could because of the lindy that existing stables have received

These achievements are just a taste of what Rari and Fei can accomplish together. I believe that we should double down on this collaborative effort for the benefit of both DAOs, communities, and the DeFi ecosystem as a whole.

I propose we bring RGT into the Tribe family and unify our efforts in creating the future of decentralized finance. Together, we will create a DeFi capable of immense TVL scaling and truly revolutionizing the way we (DeFi users today and tomorrow) interact with money and finance.
I propose:
1. $1:$1 conversion of RGT to TRIBE, created from both the existing treasury and newly minted TRIBE
2. Fei creating proper contributor incentives as a mechanism to scale Fuse / yield aggregator
3. Fully pay back the Rari DAO’s debts from the ETH yield aggregator exploit (to REPT-b holders) in Fei (full compensation in Fei, at Dai price at hack time)
4. Keep independent communities (Fei, Rari) building together under a shared Tribe family

(you can view Joey’s proposal with the details of each of the mechanics here: Fei Letter to Rari 134)

There are a number of protocol-specific collaborations that will be possible with the passing of this proposal. By combining the yield aggregator, Fuse and Fei can quickly accelerate Fei’s usage as a dominant stablecoin across various chains and layers. Additionally, we can work together on numerous joint products: various DAO treasury projects, automated liquidity products for new pools and even an innovative oracle model to guarantee liquidity for TWAPs. This will have no direct impact for the users of today. For the users of tomorrow, it should result in better products, better experiences and a wider set of possibilities. As a user of Rari, I am excited for what this means.

A treasury diversification into each other’s assets is something that we have seen before, but historically doesn’t actually provide much substance in aligning incentives because of the sheer scale of DeFi projects. By going all in with each other, we are absolutely aligned with each other’s products, communities and spirits. We are in it for the long haul, together.

By working together with the Fei community, becoming part of the Tribe family together, we instantly start to build our empire. Together, we are stronger than ever before. We will be ready to scale and conquer. I am excited about the potential of the Rari Capital community joining the Tribe family and I am stoked for what we will be able to do together.” - Jai Bhavnani

j. Transfer ownership of 0xB465BAF04C087Ce3ed1C266F96CA43f4847D9635 to Tribe Timelock.

VI. Distribution of TRIBE to RGT holders
PegExchanger will facilitate the exchange of RGT for TRIBE at the Exchange Rate. RGT may be exchanged indefinitely. Tribe governance may set an expiration date for the exchange to cease, but only at a minimum of 2,336,000 blocks, or approximately one year, after the exchange starts.

VII. Governance Transition
A. Rari Capital relies on the Rari governance token (RGT), their Governance Bravo contract, team multisig (0x5eA4A9a7592683bF0Bc187d6Da706c6c4770976F), and other contracts to function. The transfer of Rari Capital’s admin to Tribe will occur over two governance proposals. Rari governance will set a pending admin, and Tribe governance will accept the admin role.
B. The Rari Developer Multisig will transfer administrative rights of multisig-owned contracts noted in the Appendix to a joint multisig. See Appendix for more details regarding Rari Capital contracts and the controlling address or contract for each contract.

VIII. Ragequit
A. Tribe governance will permission the “Tribe Ragequit contract” as a FEI minter to enable FEI payouts for TRIBE holders.
B. Anyone who held TRIBE at the Snapshot Block will be able to exchange their TRIBE for FEI through the Tribe Ragequit contract, up to the amount of TRIBE they held at the Snapshot Block.
C. Intrinsic Value (IV) is defined as Protocol Equity (PCV - User Circulating Fei) divided by the Pre-merger TRIBE Circulating Supply. The Protocol Equity number is taken from Fei’s Collaterization Oracle and updated on each ragequit such that Protocol Equity can only be lowered.
D. When a TRIBE holder exchanges TRIBE through the Tribe Ragequit contract, the amount of FEI that they receive equals the amount of TRIBE sold multiplied by Intrinsic Value at the block in which the exchange takes place.
E. TRIBE exchanged through the Tribe Ragequit contract will be sent to the Tribe Treasury.
F. The Tribe Ragequit contract will end after 19200 blocks, or approximately 3 calendar days from the first block at which party0Accept and party1Accept are both true.

IX. Costs of Implementation
Tribe and Rari Capital will each, respectively, be solely responsible for any costs associated with due diligence, administration, deployment costs, gas fees, or any other costs unless explicitly described in this proposal.

X. Assumption of REPT-b Repayment Obligations
A. Upon both DAOs accepting the terms of the merger, Tribe acknowledges an obligation to offer FEI in exchange for REPT-b tokens.
B. No later than 90 calendar days after both DAOs accept the terms, Tribe will announce a method for exchanging REPT-b for FEI.
C. Tribe does not acknowledge assumption of any other costs associated with the events related to the distribution of REPT-b, including but not limited to the proper distribution of REPT-b, ancillary costs such as “gas” paid in ETH to redeem REPT-b for FEI, or any other costs known or unknown related to the creation of and distribution of REPT-b tokens.

XI. GFX Labs Payment
This document describes the details of a historic DAO-to-DAO merger and is expected to set an industry precedent. GFX Labs has taken the lead in providing services related to the research, organization, development, and engineering of this merger. As compensation for these valuable services, and to foster a long term relationship between Tribe and GFX Labs, Tribe will transfer 3,000,000 TRIBE to an Ethereum address chosen by GFX Labs.

XII. Treasury Assets and Future Assets
Tribe will assume control of all current Rari Capital treasury positions. Any future airdrops, or events that are similar to an airdrop, to Rari Capital will be controlled by Tribe.

XIII. Prohibitions
A. Neither Tribe nor Rari Capital will engage in any extraordinary actions after each party accepts the terms and before the merger has completed. Prohibited activities are:
1. The creation of new RGT tokens outside of a pre-determined schedule and declared as an appendix to this proposal.
2. The creation of new TRIBE tokens outside of a pre-determined schedule and declared as an appendix to this proposal.
3. The deployment of new smart contracts outside of those described and declared as an appendix to this proposal.
4. The alteration of ownership, administrative access, or other functional control over any part of Tribe governance except as described and declared as an appendix to this proposal.
5. The alteration of ownership, administrative access, or other functional control over any part of Rari Capital protocol except as described and declared as an appendix to this proposal.
6. The creation of new FEI tokens outside of routine business activities or related to the execution of this agreement.
7. The receipt or provision of any incentive, financial or otherwise, for the purposes of altering voting behavior, except as outlined within this proposal or pre-determined and declared as an appendix to this proposal.
8. The manipulation of FEI, TRIBE, or RGT prices outside of routine business activities.
B. Should Tribe or Rari Capital engage in any of the activities described in Section XIII.A, then the proposed governance merge shall be considered indefinitely postponed until a new proposal has been approved by both Tribe and Rari Capital.

XIV. Financial or Technical Statements
By accepting the TribeRagequit & PegExchanger on-chain, both Rari Capital and Tribe represent that, to the best of their knowledge, any financial or technical statements, representations, documentation, or information are correct and that all reasonable, good-faith efforts have been made to ensure their accuracy. Any financial or technical statements, representations, documentation, or information officially disclosed by either Rari Capital or Tribe are declared as an appendix to this proposal.

Executive Summary
● Each RGT can be exchanged for 26.705673 TRIBE.
● The TRIBE circulating supply prior to the merger is 619,605,725.
● TRIBE holders will have the opportunity to ragequit. Each TRIBE will be exchanged for approximately 1.22 FEI.
○ This amount is equal to (Protocol Equity / Circulating Tribe) at the time of ragequit, and changes dynamically based on Protocol Equity.
○ All FEI issued to ragequitters will be minted by Fei protocol.
○ All TRIBE received from ragequitters will be sent to the Tribe Treasury.
○ The ragequit option will be available for three calendar days after the merger proposals pass.
● Tribe will cover any outstanding Rari Capital debts.

Dilution Table

TABLE NEEDS TO BE INSERTED

The exchange of RGT for TRIBE dilutes both TRIBE and RGT holders. For example, assuming all RGT is exchanged for TRIBE, if a TRIBE holder who owns 10% of Tribe pre-merger holds on to all of their TRIBE, their ownership percentage of Tribe is reduced to 6.947% as a result of the exchange. If an RGT holder who owns 10% of Rari Capital pre-merger exchanges all of their RGT to TRIBE, their ownership percentage of Tribe becomes 3.053%.

On the other hand, a ragequit increases the ownership of remaining TRIBE holders. For example, suppose 25% of TRIBE holders ragequit after the merger. Then the ownership percentage of the TRIBE holder in the above example would increase from 6.947% to 8.407%, and the ownership percentage of the RGT holder in the above example would increase from 3.053% to 3.695%, assuming neither holder participates in the ragequit.
