THESE LIMITATIONS APPLY REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER BASED ON TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT WE WERE ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

OUR SERVICES AND ALL MATERIALS, DOCUMENTS OR FORMS PROVIDED ON OR THROUGH YOUR USE OF THE SITE OR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS-IS" AND "AS-AVAILABLE" BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, RELATING TO THE SITE OR ANY CONTENT ON THE SITE, WHETHER PROVIDED OR OWNED BY US OR BY ANY THIRD PARTY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, FREEDOM FROM COMPUTER VIRUS, AND ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, OR USAGE IN TRADE, ALL OF WHICH ARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED. IN ADDITION, WE DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE CONTENT, MATERIALS AND FORMS ACCESSIBLE VIA THE SITE ARE ACCURATE, COMPLETE, AVAILABLE, CURRENT, FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, OR THAT THE RESULTS OF USING THE SITE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS.

OBTAINING ANY FORMS OR MATERIALS THROUGH THE USE OF THE SITE OR SERVICES IS DONE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND AT YOUR OWN RISK. WE SHALL HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE DOWNLOAD OF ANY CONTENT, MATERIALS, INFORMATION OR SOFTWARE.

SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE DISCLAIMER OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMERS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. THIS PARAGRAPH GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER LEGAL RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM STATE TO STATE.

## Indemnification (or What Happens If You Get Us Sued)

To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Company Parties from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorneys’ fees) arising from: (i) your use of and access to the Site; (ii) any User Content you post, program, upload, use, distribute, store, or otherwise transmit through the Site; (iii) your violation of any term of this Agreement; or, (iv) your violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or the rights of any third party.

## Time Limitation on Claims

You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your relationship with us must be filed within one (1) year after such claim arose where, for purposes of this section, the time that the injury or harm occurred – not when it was discovered thereafter – is where it arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.

## Governing Law

No matter where you’re located, the laws of the State of Wyoming will govern these Terms and the parties’ relationship as if you signed these Terms in Wyoming, without regard to Wyoming state’s conflicts of laws rules. If any provisions of these Terms are inconsistent with any applicable law, those provisions will be superseded or modified only to the extent such provisions are inconsistent. The parties agree to submit to the federal or state courts in Wyoming for exclusive jurisdiction of any dispute arising out of or related to your use of the Services or your breach of these Terms. You waive any objection based on lack of personal jurisdiction, place of residence, improper venue, or forum non conveniens in any such action.

Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect.

## Termination

We reserve the right to terminate your license to use our Services or block or prevent your access to the Site without providing you with notice or reason.

If we terminate your account, you must immediately stop using our Services and you agree not to attempt to regain access to our Services without our express permission. Such termination will result in the suspension or deletion of your account and access to your account. In the event of termination of your account, the provisions of this Agreement shall remain in effect, and we reserve the right to retain any data or information you have provided to us or posted on the Site. We will not be liable to you for the effect that any changes to the Services may have on you, including your income or your ability to generate revenue through the Services.

If you wish to terminate your account with us, please contact us at {{Contact Email}}. Terminating your account will not affect the availability of User Content that you posted through the Services prior to termination.

## No Waiver

Our failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power, or privilege preclude any other or further exercise thereof.

## Severability

If it turns out that any term or provision of this Agreement is invalid, void, or, for any reason, unenforceable, such term or provision will be deemed severable and limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary. The limitation or elimination of the term or provision will not affect any other terms of this Agreement.

## Arbitration & Waiver of Class Action

The parties agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from this Agreement or your use of the Site on an individual basis. ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL. THE PARTIES HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY. The parties agree that: (i) any arbitration will occur in Wyoming; and, (ii) the arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of American Arbitration Association for arbitration of consumer-related disputes, in the English language, and with limited discovery. At your request, hearings may be conducted in person or by telephone and the arbitrator may provide for submitting and determining motions on briefs, without oral hearings. Other than class procedures and remedies discussed below, the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available to a court or other tribunal. THE PREVAILING PARTY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING TO ENFORCE THESE TERMS SHALL BE ENTITLED TO COSTS AND ATTORNEYS' FEES. THE ARBITRAL DECISION MAY BE ENFORCED IN ANY COURT. WHETHER THE DISPUTE IS HEARD IN ARBITRATION OR IN COURT, YOU AND CONSENSYS, INC. WILL NOT COMMENCE AGAINST THE OTHER A CLASS ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.

## Force Majeure

We shall not be held liable for any delays, failure in performance, or interruptions of service which result directly or indirectly from any cause or condition beyond our reasonable control, including but not limited to: any delay or failure due to any act of God, act of civil or military authorities, act of terrorism, civil disturbance, war, strike or other labor dispute, fire, interruption in telecommunications or Internet services or network provider services, failure of equipment and/or software, other catastrophe, or any other occurrence which is beyond our reasonable control and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

## Assignment

You agree that we may assign any of our rights and/or transfer, sub-contract, or delegate any of our obligations under these Terms. Your agreement to these Terms is personal to you and you may not transfer or assign it to any third party.

## Entire Agreement

This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding and agreement as to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any and all prior discussions, agreements, and understandings of any kind (including without limitation any prior versions of this Agreement) and every nature between us. Except as provided for above, any modification to this Agreement must be in writing and must be signed by both parties.
