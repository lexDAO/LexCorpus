# Getting Started with LexDAO Contracts

Welcome! You've made it this far, so you are probably the kind of curious sort LexDAO needs.

Here are some pointers for using [github](https://github.com/), making your first "[pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)" and testing out contracts using [Remix](http://remix.ethereum.org/).

## (1) Create Github Account

This will be necessary to propose changes to LexDAO contracts. 

Simply sign-up and create a profile by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/join).

## (2) Make Pull Request

Let's say you notice a cool fix for the LexDAO base [`Token`](https://github.com/lexDAO/LexCorpus/blob/master/contracts/token/erc20/Token.sol) contract.

To propose this change, simply click the pencil icon in the top right corner of the contract file:

## (3) Test and write contracts on Remix

If you want to make more fulsome edits or write your own projects for LexDAO, it is usually a good idea to have a standard coding environment to check assumptions and see how a contract performs on testnet. For this purpose, LexDAO recommends [Remix](http://remix.ethereum.org/), a browser application for Ethereum smart contract deployment.

You will first need a [MetaMask wallet](https://metamask.io/), which are free and secured by a 'seed phrase' that you should keep private at all times.

After downloading and setting up on your browser, you should then use a 'faucet' to fund your wallet with testnet ether, the digital currency required to deploy and interact with Ethereum contracts.

First, switch your network to a tesnet like `Kovan` on your wallet:

Go to a [Kovan faucet](https://faucet.kovan.network/) or the [Paradigm testnet facuet](https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/) and input your wallet address:

2 kETH should be sufficient for many testing purposes.
